## FileSystem

### Create swap memory

* First, you need to create the file:
```bash
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1000000
```
* Then, format the swap file:
```bash
sudo mkswap /swapfile
```
* After that, restrict the permission:
```
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
```
* Activate the swap:
```
sudo swapon /swapfile
```
* (Optional) Depending if you need to have it online when you restart the computer, you need to edit `/etc/fstab` as follow:
```bash
# FS          mountpoint  type  option(s) dump pass
/path/to/swap    none     swap      sw      0    0
```
