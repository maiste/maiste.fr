## Me

French computer scientist curious about everything, I've started this blog to
centralise my knowledge and share some pieces of my mind with others if it can
help. Everything written in this website is my opinion. It doesn't reflect the
ideas of my employers, my family or anyone else.

As I like both languages, there might be some French and some English in this
blog. Even if I'm not as comfortable in English as in French, I will do my best
to improve my writing style!
