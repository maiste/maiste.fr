        <p>
            French computer scientist curious about everything, I've started this blog to
            centralise my knowledge and share some pieces of my mind with others if it can
            help. Everything written in this website is my opinion. It doesn't reflect the
            ideas of my employers, my family or anyone else.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I like both languages, there might be some French and some English in this
            blog. Even if I'm not as comfortable in English as in French, I will do my best
            to improve my writing style!
