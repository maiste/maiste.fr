        <p>
            French computer scientist curious about everything, I've started this blog to
            centralise my knowledge and share some pieces of my mind with others if it can
            help. Everything written in this website is my opinion. It doesn't reflect the
            ideas of my employers, my family or anyone else.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I like both languages, there might be some French and some English in this
            blog. Even if I'm not as comfortable in English as in French, I will do my best
            to improve my writing style!

## Companies I work or have been working at

- [Tarides](https://tarides.com/): Currently working here, I'm mostly working
  on the OCaml build system, [dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune).
- [Takima](https://www.takima.fr/): Consulting firm where I have been working
  on a project under NDA after following the internal courses for 3 months.
- [Nomadic Labs](https://www.nomadic-labs.com/): I did my internship in the
  company. It was about quantifying the energetic consumption of the blockchain
  to ensure it was a linear and not an exponential growth.

If you are more interesting in the Open Source projects I have been working on,
I suggest you to have a look at the [Projects](/projects) page.
