## Welcome!

This is what I call my **Knowledge Forest**, a place where I grow my online
presence. It is a minimal website that tries to fit in the 512kB club (still
not a member though...). Of course, it's written using OCaml, as it wouldn't be
me if it was in another language (currently working on the OCaml build system,
[Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune))!

## Work-In-Progress

⚠️ This website is still under active development and lack a lot of features. It
will improve over time but, I wanted to have a decent base first (hence the
code does not look good actually!). If you are curious, you can follow the advancement
in the [logging](/logging) page.
