## Welcome!

This is what I call my **Knowledge Forest**, a place where I grow my online
presence. Of course, it's written using OCaml, as it wouldn't be me if it was
in another language (currently working on the OCaml build system,
[Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune))!

## Never ending story

This website is always under development. Now it reaches its new design and the
structure is one I'm satisfied with, I will slow down the visual and feature
development and move to code refactoring (you don't want to look at it today).
If you are interested in following the changes and development, you can have a
look at the [website logs](/logging).
