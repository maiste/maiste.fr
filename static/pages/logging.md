page_title: "Logs"

This page summarizes everything that I want to log about my personal projects,
conferences or anything where I want a timeline. Expect it to be absolutely
hard to read because I expect no other person than me (maybe my girlfriend) to
care about it.

## 2024

### 2024-11-24

Add this logging section. It is still hidden for the public as I do not know
how to expose it on the website. However, it will be built. I also cleaned the
`index.ml` file to make it easier to maintain in the long rune. I added some
small improvement tot the `about.md` page, but it needs to be done when I have
more time. Will look at this later.

### 2024-11-22

Move the `blog.ml` file to use the `tree.ml` structure. It is not clean at all
right now: it needs a little cleaning.
