professional career or during my personal time. I have been working on other
projects, but, as they are under a non-disclosure agreement, I can't talk
about them. However, as a person loving Open Source, most of my contributions
are available to the public.</p>

    <h2>Dune - OCaml Build System</h2><p>
      <i>
      ~Date: &nbsp;Started in 2024&nbsp; - Current</i>
      </p><div><p>Dune is the <em>Build system</em> for OCaml. It is capable of building OCaml
code to various targets: native code, OCaml Bytecode, JS and WASM. It
is a really versatile tool. I'm mainly working on the <em>Package
Management</em> feature. The goal is to be able to use <em>Dune</em> without
needing <em>opam</em>, the OCaml package manager.</p>

    <h2>Dune Developer Preview - Dune nightly builds</h2><p>
      <i>
      ~Date: &nbsp;Started in 2024&nbsp; - Current</i>
      </p><div><p>To be able to test the capacity of Dune, we needed a mechanism to build
nightly version of Dune as standalone executable. This project provides
a website with standalone executable with the testing features
available. It is also in charge of building the executables themselves.</p>

    <h2>Equinoxe</h2><p>
      <i>
      ~Date: &nbsp;Started in 2022&nbsp; - Stopped in 2024</i>
      </p><div><p><em>Equinoxe</em> was an OCaml library to interact with Equinix API. It was used in
the context of my work on <em>Irmin</em> to easily deploy test pipelines and get the
results without having to manually do the setup. While still at Tarides, I
improved and added more functionalities with the idea of creating a Mirage OS
deployer on Equinix. However, when I left, I wasn't able to work on it again.
This library is now deprecated and not used anymore. In the end, it was a
useful and interesting project to learn to write cleaner APIs.</p>

      <i>
      ~Date: &nbsp;Started in 2022&nbsp; - Stopped in 2023</i>
      </p><div><p><em>OCurrent</em> is a library that provides blocks to build workflow pipelines
with automatic caching. I maintained OCurrent in the context of
<em>OCaml-CI</em>, a continuous integration written in OCaml. I improve some
parts of the <code>ocurrent-docker</code> plugin to support the <em>Docker BuildX
engine</em>.</p>

      <i>
      ~Date: &nbsp;Started in 2022&nbsp; - Stopped in 2023</i>
      </p><div><p><em>OCaml-CI</em> is a continuous integration dedicated to the OCaml ecosystem. It
provides a zero configuration pipeline using the recommended tools for building
OCaml (e.g. <em>Dune</em>). It was started before the <em>GitHub Actions</em> service was
released and should have provided an equivalent to <em>GitLab Pipelines</em>. Even
after, it was maintained and improved to provide an in-production test for the
<em>OCurrent</em> library and, also, give numerous platforms to test your code on. My
primary focus was to maintain the services and fix the bugs. My second focus
was to develop and improve the web interface.</p>

      ~Date: &nbsp;Started in 2021&nbsp; - Stopped in 2024</i>
      </p><div><p><em>Irmin</em> is a distributed database that follows the same principles as Git. It
allows you to expose a Git-like APIs and store the data in whatever backend you
want (e.g. Git, Redis, disk, etc). I was working at Tarides on <em>Irmin</em> for the
<a href="https://tezos.com/">Tezos</a> blockchain. It was used as the storage system for
their blockchain nodes. I was in charge of taking care of the tests and helping
to develop the replay functionality, a system that allows a series of block
applications in the chain. The latter was used in _Tezos _ to debug errors in
the chain.</p>

      </p><div><p>I did my intership at <a href="https://www.nomadic-labs.com/">Nomadic Labs</a>
working on the Tezos Blockchain. I have helped improving the test
framework for tezos, Tezt (it was an internal project but was later
extracting as a standalone project) by adding support to SSH to run
some tests. My internship was about quantifying the energy consumption
of the blockchain. To do so, I wrote a library named
<a href="https://github.com/maiste/tezos-oxymeter">tezos-oxymeter</a> to
instrument the code and get information about the energy consumption.</p>

RFC 6126 bis. It was part of an internship supervised by <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~jch/">the
creator</a> of the protocol. The goal was to update the
C code to support additions to the specs. I have done the same in <em>TCPDump</em>.</p>
