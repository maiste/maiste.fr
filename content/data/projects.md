  summary: |
        Dune is the _Build system_ for OCaml. It is capable of building OCaml
        code to various targets: native code, OCaml Bytecode, JS and WASM. It
        is a really versatile tool. I'm mainly working on the _Package
        Management_ feature. The goal is to be able to use _Dune_ without
        needing _opam_, the OCaml _Package Manager_.

  summary: |
        To be able to test the capacity of Dune, we needed a mechanism to build
        nightly version of Dune as standalone executable. This project provides
        a website with standalone executable with the testing features
        available. It is also in charge of building the executables themselves.

  summary: |
        I did my intership at [Nomadic Labs](https://www.nomadic-labs.com/)
        working on the Tezos Blockchain. I have helped improving the test
        framework for tezos, Tezt (it was an internal project but was later
        extracting as a standalone project) by adding support to SSH to run
        some tests. My internship was about quantifying the energy consumption
        of the blockchain. To do so, I wrote a library named
        [tezos-oxymeter](https://github.com/maiste/tezos-oxymeter) to
        instrument the code and get information about the energy consumption.
