## Notes

 - Well define your workspace
  - Accept not to be productive some days
  - Split the work world and the personal world online
  - Concentrate meetings to not be disturbed
  - Turn off instant messaging (act like an email)
  - Need good communication between team workers
  - _Advantages of remote work_: less distraction, judged over work not presence, focus on personal rythm and own time management, more productive.
  - _Disadvantages of remote work_: higher risk of burnout, hard separation between personal and work, loneliness risks.
