## Welcome!

This is what I call my **Digital Garden**, a place where I grow my online
presence. It is a minimal website that tries to fit in the 512kB club (still
not a member though...). Of course, it's written using OCaml, as it wouldn't be
me if it was in another language (currently working on the OCaml build system,
[Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune))!

## Explore...

- The [blog](/blog) (Still need some refactoring üîß)
- The [wiki](/wiki) (This part is under construction, but it's improving) ‚öôÔ∏è)
- Who [I](/about) am (Not really a nice page but, it will improve over time ü§û)

## Important

‚ö†Ô∏è This website is still under heavy development and lack a lot of features. It
will improve over time but, I wanted to have a decent base first (hence the
code does not look good actually!).
