## Welcome!

This is what I call my **Digital Garden**, a place where I grow my online
presence. It is a minimal website that tries to fit in the 512kB club (still
not a member though...). Of course, it's written using OCaml, as it wouldn't be
me if it was in another language (currently working on the OCaml build system,
[Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune))!

## Explore...

- The [blog](/blog) (Still need some refactoring 🔧)
- The [wiki](/wiki) 
- Who [I](/about) am (Not really a nice page but, it will improve over time 🤞)
- The [projects](/projects) I have been working on.

## Work-In-Progress

⚠️ This website is still under active development and lack a lot of features. It
will improve over time but, I wanted to have a decent base first (hence the
code does not look good actually!).

I plan to:
- Port the Blog using the _tree.ml_ module,
- Setup the RSS feed back,
- Improve the content of the [about](/about) page,
- Start the blog back and write regularly about what I learn.
