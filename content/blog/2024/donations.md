## Some context

This year, I want to start a yearly tradition to give more money to the
nonprofit organisations (NPO) I think are doing an important job and to the
projects I use on a daily basis. I can't give back to everyone but I try to
give at least a little to some of them. Turning this into a tradition can be
really nice for the projects I don't give on a monthly cycle. It is a small
contribution in comparison to their work but, I hope to be able to expend the
numbers one day!

Here is the list of the donations I have made at the end of this year and why.

## Non-profits

- [Framasoft](https://framasoft.org/en/), a French NPO focus on education and
  alternative services, for their work with PeerTube, Mobilizon and all the
  services they provide that are really useful!
- [La Quadrature Du Net (LQDN)](https://www.laquadrature.net/en/), a French NPO focus
  on online privacy protection for their involvement into protecting our digital
  right in the European Union.

## Open Source Projects

- [Graphene OS](https://grapheneos.org/) because the project in really useful
  for privacy and, also, they allow me to keep using my phone by extending the
  security support for it.
- [Christina Sørensen](https://github.com/cafkafk) for her work on
  [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) because it's a tool I use every
  day!
- [David Peter](https://github.com/sharkdp) for his contributions to
  [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine)
  and, [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat), some really exciting Rust projects!
- [Daniel Eklöf](https://codeberg.org/dnkl) for his work on
  [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot) because this is my way-to-go terminal!
